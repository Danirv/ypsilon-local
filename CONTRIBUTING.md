# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. The project prioritizes reliable local control,
explicit state reconciliation, conservative mechanical writes, and reusable
interoperability knowledge.

## Before opening a pull request

1. Run `python scripts/audit.py`.
2. Run `python scripts/publication_check.py` in a configured public clone.
3. Run `python -m compileall -q custom_components/ypsilon_local scripts`.
4. Keep user-facing strings in the translation files (`en`, `ca`, `es`).
5. Prefer small, reviewable changes and preserve entity/config-entry unique ids
   unless a migration is provided.
6. For writes, distinguish command transport, protocol ACK and confirmed
   physical device state.

## Architecture boundaries

Read [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) before protocol work.

- `runxin/` must remain independent of Home Assistant and BroadLink.
- transports carry raw Runxin frames and must not decode F79D fields;
- packet/encryption/session logic belongs in a transport implementation;
- field ids, codecs and evidence belong in the device profile;
- Home Assistant decides which known writes are safe to expose;
- keep `protocol.py` as a compatibility facade, not as a place for new logic.

These boundaries are enforced by the offline audit where practical.

## Protocol research and test data

Interoperability research is welcome, but this repository must not contain
vendor APKs, firmware images, proprietary scripts/binaries, credentials, private
or pairing keys, account tokens, or unredacted captures containing user/device
identifiers.

Small sanitized protocol fixtures necessary to test independently written code
are acceptable when they contain no secrets and no substantial vendor
code/content.

When documenting a reverse-engineered fact, distinguish evidence recovered from
the legacy app, behavior observed on a real device, a physically verified write,
and an inference. Prefer an explicit `inferred` note to false certainty.

## New transports

See [`docs/adding-a-transport.md`](docs/adding-a-transport.md). A transport should
implement the raw `transact(frame: bytes) -> bytes` contract and remove only its
own envelope before returning the response.

The existence of a transport implementation does not automatically make that
hardware discoverable/supported by the Home Assistant integration.

## New Runxin devices

See [`docs/adding-a-device-profile.md`](docs/adding-a-device-profile.md). Include
the brand/model, valve/controller model, transport/module identity if known, and
which fields/commands were actually verified. Do not copy the F79D table or mark
an untested field writable merely because its numeric id looks plausible.

## Standalone-library direction

The pure protocol layer is intentionally structured so it can later be moved to
a public PyPI library if there are multiple real consumers. Until that happens,
do not introduce runtime dependencies between unrelated HACS integrations by
importing an installed `custom_components.ypsilon_local` package.
